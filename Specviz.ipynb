    "## Introduction to Specviz\n",
    "\n",
    "May 2021\n",
    "\n",
    "(Originally by Richard O'Steen here: https://github.com/spacetelescope/jwebbinar_prep/tree/main/jdat_session)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Learning Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "- Learn to load and display a spectrum in Specviz\n",
    "- Become familiar with the tools attached to the spectrum viewer\n",
    "- Become familiar with the data analysis plugins\n",
    "- Learn how to select a region of interest/subset of the spectrum\n",
    "- Learn how to overlay spectral lines on the displayed spectrum\n",
    "- Learn how to extract spectra from the Specviz app for further analysis in the notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Historical Note\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously, Specviz was one of three separate packages (Specviz, Cubeviz, and Mosviz) for visual data analysis. These packages have now been unified into separate configurations of a single project called Jdaviz and share much of the same codebase. The main relevance this has to you is that you should _not_ try to install Specviz via `pip install specviz`, as this will give you the old, no-longer-maintained package. Instead, always use `pip install jdaviz` to get Specviz and the other configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Further Resources\n",
    "\n",
    "The Specviz documentation can be found at https://jdaviz.readthedocs.io/en/latest/specviz/index.html. "

    "First, note that before selecting any subsets, the subset selection button in the app-level toolbar reads \"No selection (create new)\". This indicates that using the x-range selection tool will create a new subset, rather than editing an existing subset. To the right of that button you should see a small circle - clicking that circle shows that there are options for what the x-range selection will do. Since we're creating a new subset, the default (\"replace\") is fine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow these steps to select a new region:\n",
    "1. Click the \"hammer and screwdriver\" icon in the top left of the viewer. \n",
    "2. Use any of the pan/zoom tools (the leftmost three icons in the expanded tool tray) to zoom into the feature of interest. We'll investigate the emission feature near 1.25 microns. Zooming works by scrolling with the mouse wheel (see \"Sidebar: zooming from the notebook\" below if you can't scroll to zoom).\n",
    "3. Click the \"x-range\" selection tool in the expanded tool tray.\n",
    "4. Click and drag on the viewer to select a region around the feature. Go ahead and include some continuum on either side.\n",
    "5. Click the \"x-range\" button in the expanded tool tray to deselect the tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should now see the label \"Subset 1\" with a red triangle in the app-level toolbar where it previously said \"No selection (create new)\". The red triangle indicates that the region of the spectrum you selected in the viewer should be colored red to indicate it is in this subset."

The default behavior is to add newly loaded lines to the existing list.\n",
